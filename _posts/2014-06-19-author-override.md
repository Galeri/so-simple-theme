Design and manufacturing studio based in Barcelona and run by **Mónica Juvera**. With a free approach to luxury and industrial design, Loope explores non conventional geometries from objects, and new ways to use and build them.

From the quiet and bohemian neighborhood of Gracia, they connect with skilled craftsmen from Italy and Spain to develop surprising products. Their inspiration comes from geometry, art, architecture, and the study of new systems and structures. All converge in their determination of finding new ways of thinking useful objects, from their manufacture until it’s used by people.

Mónica Juvera is an enthusiast of design in all scales, from landscape to everyday object, from a building to a bag. She studied Architecture in México and Landscape Architecture in Barcelona. Besides Loope, she co-found MXSI, an architectural studio that has been consolidated by winning numerous prizes in international competitions.
